----- need to compare to existing one, we don't want it to be even better, do we?

***********************************************************
to be considered / for future updates / needs more testing:
***********************************************************





- Demolisher UGV plus remote detonator (Kiruex)
---- bit too much tinkering for the detonation, would need a script to detonate the "soldier" when within a region around the crosshair with the detonator
- TTI-Combat Shield range increased [kill_decay_start_time: 0.22 -> 0.25], standing accuracy increased [0.85 -> 0.9, over_wall: 0.85 -> 0.9, sustained_fire_diminish_rate: 0.6 -> 0.9], reload speed increased [reload_anim_speed: 0.66 -> 0.8], and projectile speed increased [80 -> 90]
---- needs to be tested, increased decay start and projectile speed improves it significantly along the other buffs
---- still needs to be worse than a stock shotgun
---- moving a bit slower (walking sounds and not running)
- Gilboa DBR (NC0032 & KF redfox)
---- probably not but high on the list of the waiting queue
---- shot 2 projectiles counted as 1
- Stoner 62 recoil decreased [sustained_fire_grow_step: 0.4 -> 0.35] and recovery increased [sustained_fire_diminish_rate: 1.2 -> 1.4], decreased stance accuracy rate [<blank> -> `stance_accuracy_rate="1.0"` ?]
---- is the weapon really that bad? needs to be tested more. Has already been buffed in the past
- RPD w/ bipod (oche34 & KF redfox)
---- rework, test it
- Ash 12 (Kiruex)
---- reworked, test it
- Ultimax 100 reverse-recoil light machine gun (Kiruex)
---- heavily reworked, test it
---- sometimes the spread it not changing, needs investigation
